Although Aspose Cloud provides storage facility to its customers, Aspose Cloud is not a real storage provider and therefore there is a [File Retention Policy](https://company.Aspose.cloud/legal/file-retention-policy) defined which customers needs to understand. 

Some customers are not comfortable with Aspose Cloud Storage and they want to use their own cloud storage or some other 3rd party storage services they are comfortable with.

We at Aspose Cloud, go beyond limitations and make Aspose Cloud a kind of Gateway between a Developer and the Cloud Storage he prefers. This will allow you to write your Application once, and we'll take care of both the File Formats and also letting you support many different Cloud Storage platforms through a single consistent interface.

Following pages provides you step by step configuration on how to configure Aspose Cloud with other 3rd party cloud storages.
