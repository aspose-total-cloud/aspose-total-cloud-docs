You have to complete the following steps to connect a Windows Azure cloud storage account:

* Create Azure account if you don't have one.
* Log into [Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud)
* Access the [Storages](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/storages) page
* Click on the 'Create New Storage' and select [Azure Storage](https://dashboard.groupdocs.cloud/storages/azure/create).
* Enter Storage Name, Container, Account name, Account key, and Connection from your Azure account.
* Save Storage.
Now you can use this storage with Aspose REST APIs. For instance:
