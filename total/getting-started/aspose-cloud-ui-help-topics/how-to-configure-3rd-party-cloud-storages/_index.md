There are several Cloud Storage Providers in the market. Although Aspose Cloud provides storage facility to its customers, some customers are not comfortable with Aspose Cloud Storage and want to use their own cloud storage or some other third party storage services.

We at Aspose Cloud want to go beyond limitations and make Aspose Cloud a kind of Gateway between a Developer and the Cloud Storage of its users. This will allow you to write your Application once, and we will take care of both the File Formats and also letting you support many different Cloud Storage platforms through a single consistent interface.

Following pages provide step by step configuration how to configure Aspose Cloud with other third-party cloud storages.
