You have to complete the following steps to configure the Storage:

- Create Azure account if you don't have one.
- Log into <https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/> and click onÂ **My Storage** tab.
- Select **Windows Azure Storage** under **Create New Storage** drop-down menu.
- Enter Storage Name, Account name, Account key, and connection from your Azure account.
- Save Storage.

Now you can use this storage with Aspose REST APIs. For instance:

https://api.aspose.cloud/v1.1/storage/file/testfile.txt?storage=MyAzureStorage
